Project:    CS50 Python Final
Author:     Regina Chua
Date:       DEC 2024

Instructions:
Your project must be implemented in Python.
Your project must have a main function and three or more additional functions. At least three of those additional functions must be accompanied by tests that can be executed with pytest.
Your main function must be in a file called project.py, which should be in the ‚Äúroot‚Äù (i.e., top-level folder) of your project.
Your 3 required custom functions other than main must also be in project.py and defined at the same indentation level as main (i.e., not nested under any classes or functions).
Your test functions must be in a file called test_project.py, which should also be in the ‚Äúroot‚Äù of your project. Be sure they have the same name as your custom functions, prepended with test_ (test_custom_function, for example, where custom_function is a function you‚Äôve implemented in project.py).
You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions as you see fit beyond the minimum requirement.
Implementing your project should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course‚Äôs problem sets.
Any pip-installable libraries that your project requires must be listed, one per line, in a file called requirements.txt in the root of your project.
